# Model Card for Gemma 2 Multi-Task Translation Model

## Model Details

### Model Description
This model is a **multi-task fine-tuned version of `google/gemma-2-2b`** for machine translation between English and four target languages:  
- **English → Telugu**  
- **English → Tamil**  
- **English → Hindi**  
- **English → Nepali**  

All four tasks were fine-tuned **simultaneously in a single training process** using an efficient multi-task learning approach, improving training efficiency and cross-task performance.  
The model achieves **state-of-the-art scores** across evaluation datasets.

- **Developed by:** Revanth Kumar Bondada
- **Institutional Support:** San Jose State University
- **Model type:** Causal Language Model (decoder-only Transformer) adapted for translation
- **Languages:** English, Telugu, Tamil, Hindi, Nepali
- **License:** Same as base model (`google/gemma-2-2b`)
- **Finetuned from:** `google/gemma-2-2b`

## Uses

### Direct Use
- Translate English text into Telugu, Tamil, Hindi, or Nepali.
- Educational, research, and multilingual NLP applications.

### Downstream Use
- Integration into multilingual chatbots, educational apps, and content localization pipelines.
- Further fine-tuning for domain-specific translation needs.

### Out-of-Scope Use
- Translation for languages outside the trained set.
- Use in sensitive or high-risk contexts without human verification.

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations
- Performance may be lower for domain-specific jargon.
- Possible translation inaccuracies for idiomatic or cultural expressions.

### Recommendations
- Always perform human validation for critical translation tasks.
- Fine-tune further with domain-specific parallel corpora for specialized use cases.

## How to Get Started with the Model
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import torch

model_id = "revanthkumar1999/gemma-2-Indian_languages-to-eng"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, torch_dtype=torch.float16, device_map="auto")

prompt = "Translate to Telugu: The weather is pleasant today."
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=200)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```
